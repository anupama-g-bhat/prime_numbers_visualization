##Prime Numbers Visualization
  
  ðŸ“œ Project Description
    This project generates the first N prime numbers using a custom Python function and visualizes them with Matplotlib.
    
    Prime numbers are plotted as scatter points.
  
  Color coding is used:
  
    ðŸ”µ Blue for primes less than 50
    
    ðŸ”´ Red for primes between 50 and 99
    
    ðŸŸ¢ Green for primes 100 and above

  A dashed gray line connects the points to show the growth trend of prime numbers.
  
  The project beautifully combines Python programming and basic Data Science visualization.
